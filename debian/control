Description: GNU/Linux firewall application
 OpenSnitch is a GNU/Linux firewall application.
 Whenever a program makes a connection, it'll prompt the user to allow or deny
 it.
 .
 The user can decide if block the outgoing connection based on properties of
 the connection: by port, by uid, by dst ip, by program or a combination
 of them.
 .
 These rules can last forever, until the app restart or just one time.
 .
 The GUI allows the user to view live outgoing connections, as well as search
 by process, user, host or port.
