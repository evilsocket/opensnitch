It's the window where you can see all the events that the daemon has registered.

It's divided by tabs, where you can search for events based on the type: nodes, rules, hosts, applications, etc.

The Events tab
---

This is the main log of all the connections that the daemon has intercepted. You can filter connections by action applied, word or limit the number of entries displayed.
You can also sort connections by columns.

**Note:**
There're some columns that are clickable, that will open the detail view of the item clicked.

For example: double click on a Node to open all the connections of that node:
