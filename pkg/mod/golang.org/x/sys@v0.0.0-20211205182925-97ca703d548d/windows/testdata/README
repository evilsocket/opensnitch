## ev-signed-file.exe

This was generated with:

  int main(void)
  {
      puts("Hello Gophers!");
      return 0;
  }

And then a simple clang/mingw compilation:

  i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -Os -s a.c

After, it was copied to a Windows computer where it was signed with an EV
certificate using:

  signtool sign /sha1 <ID of certificate> /fd sha256 /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 /d "Go Project EV Signing Test" a.exe
